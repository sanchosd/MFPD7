This project is an external informational panel, for an custom computer, consisting of 7" TFT display, touch screen and stereo audio amplifier, allocated in a single piece hermetical aluminium chassis. Designed as  part of an onboard navigation complex for trucks working in a mineral quarry. 
It was a challenging design for me, utilizing new intricate interface        FPD-Link - transferring over the one coaxial cable video stream, user data, encoded audio, either DC power at once, reducing the amount of connection cables to the only one, but being quite strict to realization requirements.
  Aluminium, hermetical, chassis design also was done by me. 
Elapsed time ~3 months.
